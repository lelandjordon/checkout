# Checkout

Debugging is so much more fun when it's about money!

This shopping cart isn't quite living up to our expectations. We're losing money on shipping.  We're losing money on handling.  We're losing customers due to errors.

Correct the errors and get us back on track.

1. Fork & Clone in ~/wdi/exercises.
- Change to the "checkout" dir.
- Open index.html
- Fix scripts/shopping_cart.js

## Shipping Fees:

Weight:
- < 5lbs:     $0
- 5 - 50lbs:  $5
- Over 50lbs: $10

Size:
- Small: $0
- Large: $50
- Ludricous: $2550

Add all appropriate shipping fees.

## Notes:

Remember, take small steps.  Get one thing working, commit, and move to the next.

If something looks overwhelming, break it down.  Look at one function at a time.  Each function has its own responsibility.


You do not need to change any code in the app.shoppingCart.render() function.
